-- Question 32
-- Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

-- +----+------------------+
-- | Id | Email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- | 3  | john@example.com |
-- +----+------------------+
-- Id is the primary key column for this table.

-- | Id | Email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
