/* warning

NO need to handle null if tables are joined before aggregating.
NULL columns are simply not counted (return 0 if departmend has no student)

If studnets are counted before joining, only existing department
with at least 1 student are aggregated over with count. 

Left joining full dept tables (including empty dept) will result in NULL */
